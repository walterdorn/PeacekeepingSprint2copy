Hello Walter,
I apologize for the late reply on this email. I had not been home for most of this week.
 Peacekeeping Civilians Project - https://sheridanc-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ruedajo_shernet_sheridancollege_ca/Enj89KDkGlpOtav6OErou2UBFsAOwqkEEgiQ2SJirbD5Bg

This link contains the final build, documentation, and the GitHub repository.
The Github is not the final prototype but the changes and unity files that we used over the course of the project.Â 
Thank you for your time.
D.M
